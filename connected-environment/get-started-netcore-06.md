# Getting Started on Connected Environment with .NET Core

Previous step: [Call another container](get-started-netcore-05.md)

So far we've run our application's code as if we were the only developer working on the app. In this section, we'll learn how Connected Environment streamlines team development and affords these abilities:
* Enable a team of developers to work in the same development environment.
* Each developer can iterate on their code in isolation.
* Easily test code end-to-end, without having to create mocks or simulate dependencies.
