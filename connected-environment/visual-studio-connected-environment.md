# VS Connected Environment for AKS
VS Connected Environment enables developers to rapidly develop with speed on Kubernetes. You create a Kubernetes-based environment that is fully managed in Azure and optimized for development, and then iteratively develop and debug containers in the cloud using familiar tools like VS Code, Visual Studio, or the command-line.

This approach carries several benefits:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure-managed Kubernetes development environment that is representative of production, with full access to cloud resources.
> * Easily share a Kubernetes instance across your development team to save costs and to minimize "local machine" setup for new team members.
> * Develop your code in isolation, with do end-to-end testing with other components without replicating or mocking up dependencies.
> * Full debugging of Kubernetes containers is available for .NET Core and Node.js. All other languages can be developed with the CLI.
> * Develop on MacOS, Windows, or Linux.
