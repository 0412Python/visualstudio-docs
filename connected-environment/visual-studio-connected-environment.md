# VS Connected Environment for AKS (Preview)
VS Connected Environment enables developers to develop with speed on Kubernetes. You create a Kubernetes-based environment that is fully managed in Azure and optimized for development, and then iteratively develop containers in the cloud using familiar tools like VS Code, Visual Studio, or the command-line.

This approach carries several benefits:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Get an infrastructure-less development environment that is representative of production, with full access to cloud resources.
> * Debug Node.js and .NET Core code directly in Kubernetes containers with VS Code or Visual Studio. All other languages can be developed with the command-line interface.
> * Easily share a Kubernetes instance across your development team to save costs and to minimize "local machine" setup for new team members.
> * Develop your code in isolation, and do end-to-end testing with other components without replicating or mocking up dependencies.
