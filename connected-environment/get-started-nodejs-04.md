# Getting Started on Connected Environment with Node.js

Previous step: [Create a Node.js container in Kubernetes](get-started-nodejs-03.md)

In this section, we'll use VS Code to directly debug our container running in Azure (be sure to have installed the [VS Code extension for Conneced Environment](get-started-nodejs-01.md#get-kubernetes-debugging-tools)). We'll also learn how to make our edit-run-test loop even faster. To do this, we need to configure our code project so VS Code will communicate with our development environment in Azure.
