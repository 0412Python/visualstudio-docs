## What If I Have More Than One PCN? Which One Do I use?

If you have more than one Public Customer Number (PCN), you will receive one email with a unique onboarding URL for each PCN. Each unique URL only works with the corresponding PCN, the last three digits of which are also provided in the same email. You’ll need to complete the onboarding process through the unique link in each email, for each PCN.
