# Exporting Subscription Information

In the Visual Studio subscriptions [admin portal](https:manage.visualstudio.com), you can export a list of your users and details about their assignments. This information includes their name, email address, alternate email address, subscription level, assigned date, activation status, expiration date, reference field, downloads enabled, country, language, subscription status, and subscription GUID. 

This feature is useful for a few scenarios. You can track assignment and expiration dates easily. For example, if you are transitioning from tracking subscriptions using BANs to GUIDs, you can use this report with the VLOOKUP formula in Microsoft Excel to match appropriately.  

To perform the export, simply select **Export** and the file will download to your local machine.
