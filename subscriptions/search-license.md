# Searching and filtering subscribers in Visual Studio subscriptions
The Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal allows you to find a specific subset of subscribers based on various criteria. You can filter the subscriber list by name, email address, subscription level, and various other information. 

1.  To search for a specific group of subscribers, at the top of the table, click **Filter**.

use as the basis of your search and then click **Filter**. You will then see a list of subscribers who match the criteria you chose.
