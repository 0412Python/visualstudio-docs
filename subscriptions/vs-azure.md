# Using Microsoft Azure in Visual Studio subscriptions
As a Visual Studio subscriber, you can use Microsoft Azure at no extra charge.  With your [monthly Azure credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/), Azure is your personal sandbox for dev/test.  You can provision virtual machines, cloud services, and other Azure resources.  Credit amounts vary by subscription level. 

Activate from the **Tools** category on the Benefits page of the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits): 

1.	Click on the “Activate” link at the bottom of the benefit tile.

4.	The Azure Dashboard will load, and on your first use, you’ll have the option to take a tour.  The tour consists of a series of screen tips that will point out how you can accomplish a variety of tasks and find relevant information.  Completing or closing the tour will display the Azure Dashboard. 
5.	Bookmark the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) for easy access in the future.
