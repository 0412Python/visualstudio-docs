#	How to Buy a Subscription
There are three ways to buy Visual Studio subscriptions.  
- Cloud subscriptions can be purchased through the Visual Studio Marketplace.
- Standard subscriptions can be purchased through the Microsoft Store. 
- Organizations can purchase Volume License subscriptions through resellers.  

## Buying Cloud Subscriptions through the Visual Studio Marketplace
You can buy Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise [subscriptions](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/) 
from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com). 
Learn about the full benefits for these subscriptions, 
[compare features](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/compare/) of the IDE, and find [subscription pricing](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/).

### Before you start

*	To bill your purchases, you'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/). 
You can [sign up](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) 
before your first purchase or during your first purchase in the Visual Studio Marketplace.

you'll need a ["personal" Microsoft account](https://www.microsoft.com/account) 
or a ["work or school account"](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sign-up-organization/) 
if you're buying for your organization, and they manage identities with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
