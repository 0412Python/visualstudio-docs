# Learn about subscription management

Subscription management capabilities are available for customers who have acquired subscriptions through a Volume Licensing Agreement, a Microsoft Product and Services Agreement (MPSA), or a Visual Studio Cloud Subscription.  

Given the different purchasing channels, it's important for Subscription Administrators to know how their subscriptions were procured so the appropriate permissions and user set-up can be leveraged. Information to find out how to set up administrators for each agreement type can be found in the Accessing the Portal section. 

The Visual Studio Subscriptions team created "The Visual Studio [Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions-administration/)".  The goal of this portal is to help Subscription Administrators quickly understand the tools and capabilities they have to assign and manage subscriptions within their organization. 

On the Subscriptions Administration Portal, you can learn about topics like:
- Managing subscriptions in [subscriptions management portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
- Managing subscriptions via the Volume License Service Center for those organizations that have not yet migrated to the subscriptions management portal. 
- Migrating to the new portal.
- Other tips and tricks specifically for subscription administrators.
