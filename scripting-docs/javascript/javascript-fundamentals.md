# JavaScript Fundamentals
[!INCLUDE[javascript](../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] is an interpreted, object-based scripting language.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[javascript](../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] language uses a syntax similar to that of C, and supports structured constructs, such as `if...else`, `for`, and `do...while`. Braces ({}) are used to delimit statement blocks. The language supports various data types, including `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Object`, and `Array`. It includes support for enhanced date features, trigonometric functions, and regular expressions.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[javascript](../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] uses prototypes instead of classes. You can define an object by creating a constructor function.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[javascript](../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] is a loosely typed language, which means you do not declare the data types of variables explicitly. In many cases [!INCLUDE[javascript](../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] performs conversions automatically when they are needed. For example, if you add a number to an item that consists of text (a string), the number is converted to text.
