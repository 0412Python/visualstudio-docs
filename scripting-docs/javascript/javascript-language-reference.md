# JavaScript Language Reference
[!INCLUDE[javascript](../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] is a scripting language that can be embedded in web pages and other applications.  
  
 This documentation describes the Microsoft implementation of JavaScript, which is compliant with the ECMAScript Language Specification 5th Edition. It also provides additional features that are not included in the ECMA Standards.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We have joined the community-wide effort to make [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) the web’s one-stop, premiere development resource, by redirecting all (500+ pages) of Microsoft’s JavaScript API reference from docs.microsoft.com to their MDN counterparts. For details, see this [announcement](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/18/documenting-web-together-mdn-web-docs/#kATurs7yL2KOjFcz.97).
  
 You can use [!INCLUDE[javascript](../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] code in browser applications together with HTML, CSS and the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents HTML and browser objects.  
  
-   For information about HTML, see [HTML/XHTML Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251007).  
  
-   For information about CSS, see [Cascading Style Sheets](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251008).  
  
-   For information about the DOM, see [Document Object Model (DOM)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251009).  
  
 You can also use [!INCLUDE[javascript](../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] code in Windows Store apps that run on [!INCLUDE[win8](../javascript/includes/win8-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win81](../javascript/includes/win81-md.md)], and in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that run on Windows 10. Windows Store apps can be developed in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../javascript/includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../javascript/includes/vs-dev12-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../javascript/includes/vs-dev14-md.md)]; UWP apps can be developed in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../javascript/includes/vs-dev14-md.md)].  
  
-   For information about JavaScript in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps, see [JavaScript Roadmap](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465037.aspx).  
  
-   For information about HTML and CSS in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps, see [HTML/CSS for Windows Store apps](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=250939).  
  
-   For information about the Windows Runtime and Windows Library for JavaScript APIs, see [API reference for Windows Runtime and Windows Library for JavaScript](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=250938).  
  
-   For information about using the Windows Runtime API with JavaScript, see [Using the Windows Runtime in JavaScript](../jswinrt/using-the-windows-runtime-in-javascript.md).  
  
 The JavaScript editor in Visual Studio provides IntelliSense support. For more information, see [JavaScript IntelliSense](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=256499).
