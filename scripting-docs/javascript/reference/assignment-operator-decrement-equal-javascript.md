# Assignment Operator (=) (JavaScript)
Assigns a value to a variable.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
result = expression  
```  
  
## Parameters  
 `result`  
 Any variable.  
  
 `expression`  
 Any numeric expression.  
  
## Remarks  
 The = operator behaves like other operators, so expressions that contain it have a value. This means that you can chain assignment operators as follows: `j = k = l = 0`. In this case `j`, `k`, and `l` equal zero.  
  
## Requirements  
 [!INCLUDE[jsv1](../../javascript/misc/includes/jsv1-md.md)]
