# Number Constants (JavaScript)
The following number constants are properties of the `Number` object.  
  
## Number Object Constants  
 You do not have to create `Number` object to access these constants.  
  
|Constant|Value returned|  
|--------------|--------------------|  
|`Number.EPSILON`|The smallest number that can be represented in [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)]. Equal to approximately 2.2204460492503130808472633361816E-16.|  
|`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`|The largest number that can be safely represented in JavaScript. Equal to 9007199254740991.|  
|`Number.MAX_VALUE`|The largest number that can be represented in [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)]. Equal to approximately 1.79E+308.|  
|`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`|The smallest number that can be safely represented in JavaScript. Equal to âˆ’9007199254740991.|  
|`Number.MIN_VALUE`|The closest number to zero that can be represented in [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)]. Equal to approximately 5.00E-324.|  
|`Number.NaN`|A value that is not a number.<br /><br /> In equality comparisons, `NaN` does not equal any value, including itself. To test whether a value is equivalent to `NaN`, use the [isNaN function](../../javascript/reference/isnan-function-javascript.md).|  
|`Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`|A value that is less than the largest negative number that can be represented in [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)].<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] displays `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` values as `-infinity`.|  
|`Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`|A value greater than the largest number that can be represented in [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)].<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] displays `POSITIVE_INFINITY` values as `infinity`.|  
  
## Requirements  
 [!INCLUDE[jsv2](../../javascript/reference/includes/jsv2-md.md)]  
  
 For `Number.EPSILON`, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, and `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`:  
  
 [!INCLUDE[jsv12](../../javascript/reference/includes/jsv12-md.md)]  
  
 **Applies To**: [Number Object](../../javascript/reference/number-object-javascript.md)
