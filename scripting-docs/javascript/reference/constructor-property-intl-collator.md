# constructor Property (Intl.Collator)
Specifies the function that creates a collator.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```JavaScript  
collator.constructor  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The required `collator` is the name of the collator.  
  
 The `constructor` property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. This includes all intrinsic JavaScript objects except the `Global` and `Math` objects. The `constructor` property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.  
  
## Requirements
