# Infinity Constant (JavaScript)
A number that is larger than the largest floating point number. Returns an initial value of `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`. Negative Infinity (-Infinity) is smaller than the smallest floating point number.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Infinity   
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Infinity` constant is a member of the `Global` object, and is made available when the scripting engine is initialized.  
  
## Requirements  
 The `Infinity` property was introduced in [!INCLUDE[jsv3text](../../javascript/reference/includes/jsv3text-md.md)] and was made read-only in [!INCLUDE[jsv9textspecific](../../javascript/reference/includes/jsv9textspecific-md.md)].  
  
 **Applies To**: [Global Object](../../javascript/reference/global-object-javascript.md)
