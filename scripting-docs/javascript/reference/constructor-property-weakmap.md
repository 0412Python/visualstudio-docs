# constructor Property (WeakMap)
Specifies the function that creates a `WeakMap` object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```javascript  
weakmap.constructor  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The required `weakmap` is the name of the `WeakMap` object.  
  
 The `constructor` property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. This includes all intrinsic JavaScript objects except the `Global` and `Math` objects. The `constructor` property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.
