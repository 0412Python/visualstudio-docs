# JavaScript Reserved Words
[!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] has a number of reserved words that you cannot use as identifiers. Reserved words have a specific meaning to the [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] language, as they are part of the language syntax. Using a reserved word causes a compilation error when loading your script.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] also has a list of future reserved words. These words are not currently part of the [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] language, although they are reserved for future use. For more information about future reserved keywords in JavaScript, see [JavaScript Future Reserved Words](../../javascript/reference/javascript-future-reserved-words.md).  
  
 When choosing identifiers it is also important to avoid any words that are already the names of intrinsic [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] objects or functions, such as `String` or `parseInt`.
