# constructor Property (Intl.NumberFormat)
Specifies the function that creates a formatter.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```JavaScript  
numberFormatter.constructor  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The required `numberFormatter` is the name of the formatter.  
  
 The `constructor` property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. This includes all intrinsic JavaScript objects except the `Global` and `Math` objects. The `constructor` property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.  
  
## Requirements
