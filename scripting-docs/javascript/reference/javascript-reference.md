# JavaScript Reference
These sections explain the elements that make up the [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] language.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] code in Internet Explorer can interact with HTML, CSS and the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents HTML and browser objects.  
  
-   For information about HTML, see [HTML/XHTML Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251007).  
  
-   For information about CSS, see [Cascading Style Sheets](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251008).  
  
-   For information about the DOM, see [Document Object Model (DOM)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251009).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] code can be used in browser applications as well as [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps. [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps are supported in [!INCLUDE[win8](../../javascript/includes/win8-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../javascript/includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)] and in [!INCLUDE[win81](../../javascript/includes/win81-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../../javascript/includes/vs-dev12-md.md)].  
  
-   For information about JavaScript in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps, see [JavaScript roadmap](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4f28182b-1e4b-4bbd-8ae9-dcc504de4341).  
  
-   For information about HTML and CSS in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps, see [HTML/CSS for Windows Store apps](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=250939).  
  
-   For information about [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] APIs, see [API reference for Windows Runtime and Windows Library for JavaScript](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=250938).  
  
 The JavaScript editor in Visual Studio provides IntelliSense support. For more information, see [JavaScript IntelliSense](../../../docs/ide/javascript-intellisense.md).
