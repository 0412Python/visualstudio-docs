# JavaScript Constants
The following table lists predefined [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] constants that you can use in expressions.  
  
## Constants  
  
|Constant|Description|[!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] object|  
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|[E](../../javascript/reference/math-constants-javascript.md)|The mathematical constant e. This is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms.|`Math`|  
|[Infinity](../../javascript/reference/infinity-constant-javascript.md)|A value that is larger than the largest floating point number. Negative Infinity (-Infinity) is smaller than the smallest floating point number.|`Global`|  
|[LN2](../../javascript/reference/math-constants-javascript.md)|The natural logarithm of 2.|`Math`|  
|[LN10](../../javascript/reference/math-constants-javascript.md)|The natural logarithm of 10.|`Math`|  
|[LOG2E](../../javascript/reference/math-constants-javascript.md)|The base-2 logarithm of e.|`Math`|  
|[LOG10E](../../javascript/reference/math-constants-javascript.md)|The base-10 logarithm of e.|`Math`|  
|[MAX_VALUE](../../javascript/reference/number-constants-javascript.md)|The largest number that can be represented in [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)].|`Number`|  
|[MIN_VALUE](../../javascript/reference/number-constants-javascript.md)|The closest number to zero that can be represented in [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)].|`Number`|  
|[NaN](../../javascript/reference/number-constants-javascript.md)|Indicates that an arithmetic expression returned a value that is not a number.|`Number`|  
|[NaN (Global)](../../javascript/reference/nan-constant-javascript.md)|A value that indicates that an expression is not a number.|`Global`|  
|[NEGATIVE_INFINITY](../../javascript/reference/number-constants-javascript.md)|A value that is smaller than the smallest floating point number.|`Number`|  
|[null Constant (JavaScript)](../../javascript/reference/null-constant-javascript.md)|The value of a variable that does not point to valid data.|`Global`|  
|[PI](../../javascript/reference/math-constants-javascript.md)|Pi. This is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.|`Math`|  
|[POSITIVE_INFINITY](../../javascript/reference/number-constants-javascript.md)|A value that is larger than the largest floating point number.|`Number`|  
|[SQRT1_2](../../javascript/reference/math-constants-javascript.md)|The square root of 0.5, or, equivalently, one divided by the square root of 2.|`Math`|  
|[SQRT2](../../javascript/reference/math-constants-javascript.md)|The square root of 2.|`Math`|  
|[undefined](../../javascript/reference/undefined-constant-javascript.md)|The value of a variable that has been declared but not initialized.|`Global`|
