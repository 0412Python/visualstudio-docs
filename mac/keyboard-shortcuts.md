## Find in files

`&#8984; + Shift + F`

## File Switcher

Allows quick switching between files:

`ctrl + tab`

## Move lines around in Editor

`alt up / alt down` 

Use the Alt-Up command to move the current line or current selected lines up, and use the Alt-Down command to move the lines down. If the language add-in supports it, the lines will be re-indented to match the context when they move in and out of scope.

## Word navigation

Moves the caret to the next or previous word:

`&#8984; + Left/Right`

## Expands the Selection

Expands word, sub-expressions, statement, and line member selection in a logical way:

`alt shift up` to select
`alt shift down` to de-select
