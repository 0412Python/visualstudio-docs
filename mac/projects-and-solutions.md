Xamarin Studio provides a *Solution Pad* to display a tree view of the entire open solution that allows easy access to source code, resources, user interfaces, and assembly reference contained in individual Projects. The Solution Pad, by default, opens one solution at any one time. Each Solution can include many projects, and each project can contain many items.

## Using Projects and Solutions

To create a new Project or Solution, refer to the [Creating new Projects and Solutions](~/create-new-projects) guide.

## Project and Solution Options

You can manage the properties of both projects and solutions by either double-clicking on the Project/Solution name, or by right-clicking and browsing to **Options**. More information on these options are provides in the [Managing Solutions and Project Properties](~/managing-solutions-and-project-properties) guide.
