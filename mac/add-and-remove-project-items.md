# Adding and Removing Project Items

You can add new project items to your project by right-clicking on the project node in the **Solution Pad** and browsing to **Add > New File**:

![]()

This will display the New File Dialog, which provides file templates based on the type of application you are creating, in addition to the default, such as Empty Classes or Empty Enumerations. For Example, if you are writing an iOS application, you can select to create a new empty Storyboard file:

![]()

## Adding Existing Files

## Removing Items
