# Licensing

Visual Studio for Mac provides you with three different subscription levels to choose from, all accessible from one download:

* Visual Studio Enterprise for Mac
* Visual Studio Professional for Mac
* Visual Studio Community for Mac

To start using a subscription, log in to Visual Studio for Mac by following the steps in the [Signing in to Visual Studio for Mac](~/signing-in.md) guide. This will automatically activate your license, and display it in the accounts dialog:

## Update expired licenses 

If your subscription has expired, you have two options:

1. Renew your subscription. You can renew your subscription by browsing to [https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/).

2. If you have another account with an active subscription, you can add it to Visual Studio for Mac as detailed in the [Adding multiple user accounts](~//signing-in,md) topic. Visual Studio for Mac will detect the best available license from all accounts that you have added.
