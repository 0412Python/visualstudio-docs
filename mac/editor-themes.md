Editor themes can be changed to any of the ten color schemes provided by default in Xamarin Studio via the **Preferences > Text Editor > Syntax Highlighting** menu options:

The developer also has fine grain control over syntax highlighting, allowing the creation of custom color schemes. This is done via the **Syntax Highlighting** menu, which is displayed in the image above. Select the **New** button, choose the color scheme desired for the new color scheme to be based on, and click **OK**. This will allow changing the foreground and background colors for many different objects, as illustrated below:
