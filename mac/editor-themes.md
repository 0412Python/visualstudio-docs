# Editor Themes
Editor themes can be changed to any of the ten color schemes provided by default in Visual Studio for Mac via the **Preferences > Text Editor > Color Themes** menu options:

## Adding new Themes

New color themes can be added, provided they are in one of the supported formats. These are:

* Visual Studio (`.vssettings`)
* Xamarin Studio (`.json`)
* TextMate (`.tmTheme`)

There are many resources provided online that will allow you to create your theme and produce a file in the supported format. There are also many galleries online that will provide free access to Visual Studio and TextMate themes.

Once you have found or created a new theme and downloaded it to your local machine, add it by doing the following:

1. Select the **Add** button on the Color Themes Option dialog:   
    ![Color Theme Add](media/source-editor-image20.png)
2. Browse for the theme on your local machine and press **Open**.
3. This adds the theme to the bottom of the pre-installed list of themes. To preview it, select it. This will update your editor in the background:

4. To apply it, press the **Okay** button.
