Visual Basic provides the following refactoring features:

* [Change Method Signature](refactoring/change-method-signature.md)
* [Encapsulate Field](refactoring/encapsulate-field.md)
* [Extract Interface](refactoring/extract-interface.md)
* [Extract Interface](refactoring/extract-interface.md)
* [Extract Method](refactoring/extract-method.md)
* [Inline Temporary Variable](refactoring/inline-temporary-variable.md)
* [Move Type to Matching File](refactoring/move-type-to-matching-file.md)
