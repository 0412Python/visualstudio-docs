# Generate Method
**What:** Lets you immediately add a method to a class. 

**When:** You introduce a new method and want to properly declare it, automatically.  

**Why:** You could declare the method and parameters before using it, however this feature will generate the declaration automatically. 

**How:**

1. Place your cursor on the line where there is a red squiggle indicating you've used a method that doesn't yet exist.

1. Next, do one of the following:
   * **Keyboard**
     * Press **Ctrl+.** to trigger the **Quick Actions and Refactorings** menu and select **Generate method** from the Preview window popup.
   * **Mouse**
     * Right-click and select the **Quick Actions and Refactorings** menu and select **Generate method** from the Preview window popup.
     * Hover over the red squiggle and click the ![Lightbulb](media/bulb.png) icon which appears.
     * Click the ![Lightbulb](media/bulb.png) icon which appears in the left margin if the text cursor is already on the line with the red squiggle.
