# How to use Boost.Test for C++ in Visual Studio

In **Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5** and later, Boost.Test is integrated into the Visual Studio IDE as a component of the **Desktop Development with C++** workload. To install it on your machine, open the Visual Studio Installer and find **Boost.Test Adapter** under the list of workload components:

![Install Boost Test](media/cpp-boost-component.png "Install Boost.Test for C++")

## Install Boost

Boost.Test requires [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)! If you do not have Boost installed, we recommend that you use the Vcpkg package manager.

1. Follow the instructions at [Vcpkg: a C++ Package Manager for Windows](/cpp/vcpkg) to install vcpkg (if you don't already have it).

1. Run `vcpkg install boost:x86-windows-static` to install the Boost static library.

1. Run the `vcpkg integrate install` command to configure Visual Studio with the library and include paths to the Boost headers and binaries.

## Create a project for your tests

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, no pre-configured test project or item templates are  available for Boost.Test. Therefore, you have to create a console application project to hold your tests. Test templates for Boost.Test are planned for inclusion in a future version of Visual Studio. 

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right click on the solution node and choose **Add** > **New Project**.

1. In the left pane, choose **Windows Desktop** and then choose **Windows Console Application** in the center pane.

1. Give the project a name and choose **OK**.

## Link and configuration (Boost static library only)

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the Project node and choose **Unload Project**. Then right-click the project node and choose **Edit â€¦vcxproj**.

1. Add two lines to the Globals property group as shown here:

```xaml
<PropertyGroup Label="Globals">
 ....
    <VcpkgTriplet>x86-windows-static</VcpkgTriplet>
    <VcpkgEnabled>true</VcpkgEnabled>
</PropertyGroup>
```

1. Right-click on the project node, then choose **Properties > C/C++ > Code Generation > Runtime Library** and select `/MTd` for debug static runtime library or `/MT` for release static runtime library.

1. Choose **Linker > System > Subsystem** and make sure that it is set to **Console**.

1. Reload the project file and build the project.

## Add include directives

1. If there is a `main` function in your test .cpp file, delete it.

1. In your test .cpp file, add any needed `#include` directives to make your program's types and functions visible to the test code. Typically, the program is up one level in the folder hierarchy. If you type `#include "../"`, an IntelliSense window appears and enables you to select the full path to the header file.

![Add #include directives](media/cpp-gtest-includes.png "Add include directives to the test .cpp file")

You can use the standalone library with:

```cpp
#include <boost/test/unit_test.hpp>
```

or use the single-header version with:

```cpp
#include <boost/test/included/unit_test.hpp>
```

Then define `BOOST_TEST_MODULE`.

The following example is sufficient for the test to be discoverable in **Test Explorer**:

```cpp
#define BOOST_TEST_MODULE MyTest
#include <boost/test/included/unit_test.hpp> //single-header
#include "../MyProgram/MyClass.h" // project being tested
#include <string>

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(my_boost_test)
{
	std::string expected_value = "Bill";

    // assume MyClass is defined in MyClass.h
    // and get_value() has public accessibility
    MyClass mc;
	BOOST_CHECK(expected_value == mc.get_value());
}
```

## Write and run tests
You are now ready to write and run Boost Tests. See the [Boost Test Library Documentation](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html) for information about the test macros. See [Run unit tests with Test Explorer](run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer.md) for information about discovering, running, and grouping your tests by using **Test Explorer**.
