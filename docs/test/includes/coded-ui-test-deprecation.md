> [!NOTE]
> Coded UI tests for automated UI-driven functional testing is deprecated in Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2019 is the last version where coded UI tests will be available. We recommend using [Selenium](https://docs.seleniumhq.org/) for testing web apps and [Appium with WinAppDriver](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver) for testing desktop and UWP apps.
