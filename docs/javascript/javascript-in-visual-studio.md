# JavaScript in Visual Studio

[!include[vs_dev15](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)] provides a powerful JavaScript editing experience right out of the box. Powered by a TypeScript based language service, Visual Studio delivers richer [JavaScript IntelliSense](../ide/javascript-intellisense.md), support for modern JavaScript features, and improved productivity features such as Go to Definition, refactoring, and more.

You can write JavaScript code for many application types and services, some of which may require specific workloads or extensions to be installed. The following list has links to more information for specific project types.

-   To create cross-platform apps using Apache Cordova, see [Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/cross-platform/tools-for-cordova/).

=======
-   To create [Windows Store](http://dev.windows.com/develop), [Windows Phone](http://dev.windows.com/develop), and universal apps (that support both platforms), [get the tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads).

-   To create cloud-based services, see the [Microsoft Azure site](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/).  
  
-   To create web sites and web apps, [see the ASP.NET site](http://www.asp.net/get-started/websites).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can create an empty ASP.Net Web site and use it for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming. The Webconfig file provided by ASP.NET enables debugging in Visual Studio (or you can use F12 tools when you run the app).
