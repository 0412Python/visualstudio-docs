# How to: Build SharePoint solutions

Building your SharePoint solution is no different than building other applications in Visual Studio. For more information about building applications, see [Compiling and Building in Visual Studio](../ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio.md). For a discussion of some considerations that are specific to SharePoint solutions, see [How to: Deploy and Publish a SharePoint Solution to a Local SharePoint Site](../sharepoint/how-to-deploy-and-publish-a-sharepoint-solution-to-a-local-sharepoint-site.md).

## To build SharePoint solutions

1.  Decide whether you are making a debug or a release build. For more information, see [Debugger Project Settings](../debugger/debugger-project-settings.md).

2.  Choose the appropriate option for building or rebuilding your solution or project. For more information, see [Compiling and Building in Visual Studio](../ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio.md).

3.  On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**.
