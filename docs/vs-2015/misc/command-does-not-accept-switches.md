# Command does not accept switches.
This error generally occurs when a switch has been supplied for a command that recognizes only arguments.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Review the syntax requirements for the command. For more information, see [Visual Studio Commands with Arguments](../ide/reference/visual-studio-commands.md).
