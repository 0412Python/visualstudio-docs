# Command &lt;name&gt; is not available.
This error generally occurs when a command is entered in the **Command** window or the **Find/Command** box that is not valid, based on the current state of Visual Studio. For example, the `File.CloseSolution` command is not valid if a solution is not currently open in Visual Studio.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Choose a different command.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Make a different selection for the command to operate on.
