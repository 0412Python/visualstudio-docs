# MSBuild Error MSB4133
**MSB4133: A default tools version "\<x.x.>" was specified, but its definition could not be found.**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] cannot find the Toolset that is defined in the project file as the `DefaultToolsVersion`.  
  
### To correct this error
