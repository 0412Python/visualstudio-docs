# MSBuild Error MSB2009
**Attribute '\<attribute name>' of element '\<element name>' is not valid.**  
  
 The attribute name is not spelled correctly or is not recognized by [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)].  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Check the spelling of the attribute name.  
  
-   Check whether the project file has been modified or corrupted. If it has been modified or corrupted, open the project in the version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] in which it was created, save it, and then attempt to convert it again.
