# How to: Get a Service from the DTE Object
A service can be obtained from any program that has access to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Automation <xref:EnvDTE.DTEClass> object. For example, you can access the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsActivityLog> service from a wizard through the DTE object. You can use this service to write to the activity log. For more information, see [How to: Use the Activity Log](../extensibility/how-to-use-the-activity-log.md).  
  
 The DTE object implements <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IServiceProvider>, which you can use to query for a service from managed code by using <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ServiceProvider.GetService%2A>.  
  
### To get a service from the DTE object  
  
1.  The following code creates a <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ServiceProvider> from the DTE object and calls <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ServiceProvider.GetService%2A> with the type of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsActivityLog> service. The service is cast to the interface <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsActivityLog>, which is used to write an entry in the activity log. For more information abou how to write to the activity log, see [How to: Use the Activity Log](../extensibility/how-to-use-the-activity-log.md).
