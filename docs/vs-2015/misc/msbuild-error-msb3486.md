# MSBuild Error MSB3486
**MSB3486: Cannot get certificate from store '\<certificate store>'.**  
  
 The `ResolveKeySource` MSBuild task generates this error when the certificate matching the thumbprint of your project's .pfx file is not found in your personal certificate store.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure that the thumbprint of your project's .pfx file matches that of the certificate in your personal certificate store.
