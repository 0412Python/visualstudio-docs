# CLS Compliance Warning CLS02409
The methods that implement the getter and setter methods of a property shall be marked SpecialName in the metadata  
  
 The methods that implement the getter and setter methods of a property were not marked with **specialname** in the metadata.  
  
 For more information CLS compliance checking, see [CLS Compliant Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3320b57e-ea55-4697-a17d-f509a36a3c93).  
  
 The following function declaration (using MSIL assembly language) shows what could cause CLS02409:  
  
```  
.method public instance int32   
        get_MyProperty() cil managed  
```  
  
 By adding the **specialname** keyword, you can resolve this warning:  
  
```  
.method public specialname instance int32   
        get_MyProperty() cil managed  
```
