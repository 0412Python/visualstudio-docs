# &lt;name&gt; is not a valid project name.
This error generally occurs when the `File.NewProject` command is issued from the **Command** window or **Find/Command** box and an incorrect project name is entered for *projectname*.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Verify that the project name does not contain extra spaces and is not a reserved word such as NUL, CON, or AUX.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Re-type the command, omitting the project name.
