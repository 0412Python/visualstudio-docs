# MSBuild Error MSB1011
**Specify which project or solution file to use because this folder contains more than one project or solution file.**  
  
 If a project file is not specified at the command line, [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in "proj" or "sln" and uses that file. The current working directory contains more than one file that has a file extension that ends in "proj" or "sln".  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Include the project file name on the command line. For example, instead of typing `msbuild`, type `msbuild myapp.proj`.
