# At least one configuration was not loaded because it does not have a configuration name attribute
Each `<Config>` section in a .csproj or .vbproj file must have a Name attribute that defines a unique name for that configuration. This diagnostic indicates that the Name attribute is missing. If the Name attribute on a Configuration is missing, then that configuration will not be loaded into the project.  
  
 This error is most likely caused by editing the project file by hand.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Insert a a configuration name right after the `<Config>` line in the project file.  
  
    ```  
    Name = "someconfigname"  
    ```  
  
     A typical configuration name is `Debug` or `Release`.
