# MSBuild Error MSB3143
**MSB3143: An error occurred trying to copy '\<file>' for item '\<package>': '\<error>'**  
  
 This error occurs when bootstrapper packages are copied to the build output directory. Possible causes for this error could be:  
  
-   You do not have permission to copy to the build output directory.  
  
-   The disk is full.  
  
 These are the same potential reasons that file.copy or directory.createdirectory fail.
