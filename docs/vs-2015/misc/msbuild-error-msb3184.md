# MSBuild Error MSB3184
**MSB3184: Input manifest is invalid.**  
  
 This error is generated when the build process tries to load a file, expecting that it contains either an application manifest or a deployment manifest, but it turns out to contain something else (such as a different manifest or corrupt data).  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Verify that the manifests in your project are valid and appropriate.
