# MSBuild Error MSB3177
**MSB3177: Reference '\<reference>' does not allow partially trusted callers.**  
  
 This warning is generated during application manifest generation when the application is a partially trusted application and if *reference* was added as a project reference, has a strong name, and does not have the APTCA attribute.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Add the APTCA attribute to the referenced assembly, or stop using it, if the former is not possible.
