# MSBuild Error MSB2001
**Element \<{0}> does not contain the required attribute "{1}".**  
  
 The project being converted was either modified, corrupted, or not created by [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Check whether the project file has been modified or corrupted. If it has been modified or corrupted, open the project in the version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] in which it was created, save it, and then attempt to convert it again.
