# VSPackage Essentials
VSPackages are software modules that make up and extend Visual Studio with UI elements, services, projects, editors, and designers. VSPackages are the central architectural unit of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] itself is written mostly as a collection of VSPackages.  
  
 To create a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] extensibility application, you first create a VSPackage. You can then add menu commands, tool windows, document windows, or other code to extend the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] IDE.  
  
 To use VSPackages, you need to install the Visual Studio SDK. To follow this walkthrough, you must install the Visual Studio SDK. For more information, see [Visual Studio SDK](../extensibility/visual-studio-sdk.md).
