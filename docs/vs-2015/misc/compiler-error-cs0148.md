# Compiler Error CS0148
The delegate 'delegate' does not have a valid constructor  
  
 You imported and used a managed program (one that uses the .NET Framework common language runtime) that was created with another compiler. That compiler allowed an ill-formed [delegate](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0bb8cb6d-2f87-47c7-9d1f-d65c1cd01e9f) constructor. For more information, see [Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/97de039b-c76b-4b9c-a27d-8c1e1c8d93da).
