# MSBuild Error MSB4136
**MSB4136: Error reading the configuration information.**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] received an error when it tried to read the Toolset information in the [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] configuration file (msbuild.exe.config).  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure that the configuration file is correct and well-formed. For example, if you have customized the .config file by adding a Toolset, check the Toolset definition.
