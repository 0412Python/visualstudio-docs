# MSBuild Error MSB3253
**MSB3254: The assembly \<name> referenced in the project depends on \<name2> which is not contained in the .NET Framework Client Profile.**  
  
 One of the assemblies, or dependent assemblies, referenced in the project depends on another assembly that is not contained in the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../includes/net-client-v35-long-md.md)].  
  
 This message typically occurs when a project references a third-party control or DLL that itself references an external assembly. For example, a project uses a control that in turn uses functionality that is contained in the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. If the application is re-targeted to [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../includes/net-client-v35-long-md.md)] and is installed on a system that does not have [!INCLUDE[net_v35_long](../includes/net-v35-long-md.md)], the application may not work correctly if it tries to access functionality that is not contained in the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../includes/net-client-v35-long-md.md)] subset.  
  
 This "error" message is actually only a warning; the application will still compile. However, it may fail later if the control or DLL refers to functionality that is located in a missing assembly.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../includes/net-client-v35-long-md.md)] is a subset of the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] 3.5 run-time library. For more information about the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../includes/net-client-v35-long-md.md)], see [.NET Framework Client Profile](../Topic/.NET%20Framework%20Client%20Profile.md).  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Either remove the specified assembly reference from the project, or target the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] instead of the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../includes/net-client-v35-long-md.md)] subset library. For information about how to target the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], see [How to: Target a Version of the .NET Framework](../ide/how-to-target-a-version-of-the-dotnet-framework.md).
