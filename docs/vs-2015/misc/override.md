# override
The `override` keyword has essentially the same meaning and syntax in both ISO C++ and in C++ Component Extensions (C++/CLI and C++/CX). However, there are some differences in the implications of its use. For details, see these articles:  
  
 For ISO C++:  
  
-   ISO C++ [override](../misc/override.md)  
  
-   ISO C++ [Explicit Overrides (C++)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee583234-5cda-4e90-b55e-3f9fbf079ced)  
  
-   (Windows Store apps) [Ref classes and structs (C++/CX)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3d736b82-0bf0-48cf-bac1-cc9d110b70d1)  
  
-   [override](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/34d19257-1686-4fcd-96f5-af07c70ba914)
