# Supplying XML Code Comments
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Supplying XML Code Comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/supplying-xml-code-comments).  
  
You can make the comments in source code files available as IntelliSense. When you add the /doc switch to the Visual Basic, C#, or C++ compiler command line, an .xml file is generated that serves as the basis for IntelliSense documentation.  
  
 For more information about documenting code in Visual Basic, see see [How to: Create XML Documentation](../Topic/How%20to:%20Create%20XML%20Documentation%20in%20Visual%20Basic.md).  
  
 For more information about documenting code in C#, see [XML Documentation Comments](../Topic/XML%20Documentation%20Comments%20\(C%23%20Programming%20Guide\).md).  
  
 For more information about documenting code in C++, see [Comments](../Topic/Comments%20\(C++\).md) and [XML Documentation](../Topic/XML%20Documentation%20\(Visual%20C++\).md).
