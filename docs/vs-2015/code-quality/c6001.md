# C6001
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6001: using uninitialized memory \<variable>  
  
 This warning is reported when an uninitialized local variable is used before it is assigned a value. This could lead to unpredictable results. You should always initialize variables before use.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because variable `i` is only initialized if `b` is true; otherwise an uninitialized `i` is returned:  
  
```  
int f( bool b )  
{  
   int i;  
   if ( b )  
   {  
      i = 0;  
   }  
   return i; // i is unintialized if b is false  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, initialize the variable as shown in the following code:  
  
```  
int f( bool b )  
{  
   int i= -1;  
  
   if ( b )  
   {  
      i = 0;  
   }  
   return i;  
}  
```
