[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [C28232](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-quality/c28232).  
  
warning C28232: _Pre\_, _Post\_, or _Deref\_ not applied to any annotation  
  
 This warning indicates that a `_Pre_`, `_Post_`, or `_Deref_` operator appears in an annotation expression without a subsequent functional annotation; the modifier was ignored, but this indicates an incorrectly coded annotation.
