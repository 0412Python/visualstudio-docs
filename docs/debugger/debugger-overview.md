# Overview of the Visual Studio debugger

The Visual Studio debugger allows you to observe the run-time behavior of your program and locate logic errors. The debugger works with all Visual Studio programming languages and their associated libraries. With the debugger, you can break execution to step through your code and evaluate variables in your application.  

![Set a Breakpoint](../debugger/media/dbg-tour-set-a-breakpoint.gif "Set a breakpoint")

The debugger allows you to inspect variables and set watches, view the call stack, set conditional breakpoints, debug on remote devices, debug multithreaded apps, and leverage many other features.
