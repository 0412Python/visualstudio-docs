# Run Windows Store apps on a remote machine
![Applies to Windows only](../debugger/media/windows_only_content.png "windows_only_content")  
  
To run a Windows Store app on a remote machine, you must attach to it using the Visual Studio Remote Tools. The Remote Tools enable you to run, debug, profile, and test a Windows Store app that is running on one device from a second computer that is running Visual Studio. Running on a remote device can be especially effective when the Visual Studio computer does not support functionality that is specific to Windows Store apps, such as touch, geo-location, and physical orientation. This topic describes the procedures to configure and start a remote session.

In some scenarios, the remote tools are automatically installed when you deploy to a remote device.

- For Windows 10 PCs running Creators Update and later versions, see [Debug an Installed App Package](debug-installed-app-package.md#remote). Remote tools will be installed automatically.
- For Windows 10 Xbox, IOT, and HoloLens devices, see [Debug an Installed App Package](debug-installed-app-package.md#remote). Remote tools will be installed automatically.
- For Windows Phone, you must be physically connected to the phone, you must either install a [developer's license](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh974578.aspx) (Windows Phone 8 and 8.1) or enable [developer mode](/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) (Windows Mobile 10), and you must select **Device** as the debug target. Remote tools are not required or supported.

For Windows 8.1 PCs and Windows 10 PCs running a pre-Creator's Update version of Windows, you must install the remote tools on the remote machine manually before you can debug. Follow the instructions in this topic.
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites  
 To debug on a remote device:  
  
-   The remote device and the Visual Studio computer must be connected over a network or connected directly through an Ethernet cable. Debugging over the internet is not supported.  

- The remote device must be enabled for development.

    - For Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 devices, a [developer's license](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh974578.aspx) must be installed on the remote device.
    - For Windows 10 devices, you must enable [developer mode](/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development). 
  
-   For Windows 10 PCs running a version of Windows 10 earlier than Windows 10 Creator's Update, you must install and run the remote debugging components.
  
-   You must be an administrator on the remote device to configure the firewall during installation. You must have user access to the remote device to run or connect to the remote debugger.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Security"></a> Security  
 By default, the remote debugger uses Windows Authentication.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  You can also choose to run the remote debugger in No Authentication mode, but this mode is strongly discouraged. There is no network security when you run in this mode. Choose the No Authentication mode only if you are sure that the network is not at risk of from malicious or hostile traffic.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_DirectConnect"></a> How to connect directly to a remote device  
 To connect directly to a remote device, connect the Visual Studio computer to the device with a standard Ethernet cable. If the device does not have an Ethernet port, you can use a USB to Ethernet adapter to connect to the cable.  
  
## <a name="BKMK_download"></a> Download and Install the Remote Tools

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Debugging Windows Store apps requires Visual Studio 2013 or more recent versions.

[!INCLUDE [remote-debugger-download](../debugger/includes/remote-debugger-download.md)]
  
## <a name="BKMK_setup"></a> Set up the remote debugger

[!INCLUDE [remote-debugger-configuration](../debugger/includes/remote-debugger-configuration.md)]
  
##  <a name="BKMK_ConnectVS"></a> Configuring the Visual Studio project for remote debugging  
 You specify the remote device to connect to in the properties of the project. The procedure differs depending on the programming language. You can type the network name of the remote device, or you can select it from the Select Remote Debugger Connection dialog box.  
  
 ![Select Remote Debugger Connection dialog box](../debugger/media/vsrun_selectremotedebuggerdlg.png "VSRUN_SelectRemoteDebuggerDlg")  
  
 The dialog box lists only those devices that are on the local subnet of the Visual Studio computer and that are running the remote debugger.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  If you have trouble connecting to a remote device, try entering the IP address of the device. To determine the IP address of a device, open a command window and then type **ipconfig**. The IP address is listed as **IPv4 Address**.

 ![Managed project properties for remote debugging](../debugger/media/vsrun_managed_projprop_remote.png "VSRUN_Managed_ProjProp_Remote")  
  
1.  Select the project name in Solution Explorer and then choose **Properties** from the shortcut menu.  
  
2.  Select **Debug**.  
  
3.  Choose **Remote Machine** from the **Target Device** list.  
  
4.  Enter the network name of the remote device in the **Remote Machine** box or choose **Find** to choose the device from the **Select Remote Debugger Connection** dialog box.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_Choosing_the_remote_device_for_JavaScript_and_C___projects"></a> Choosing the remote device for JavaScript and C++ projects  
 ![C&#43;&#43; project properties for remote debugging](../debugger/media/vsrun_cpp_projprop_remote.png "VSRUN_CPP_ProjProp_Remote")  
  
1.  Select the project name in Solution Explorer and then choose **Properties** from the shortcut menu.  
  
2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node and then select **Debugging**.  
  
3.  Choose **Remote Debugger** from the **Debugger to launch** list.  
  
4.  Enter the network name of the remote device in the **Machine Name** box or choose the down arrow in the box to choose the device from the **Select Remote Debugger Connection** dialog box.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_RunRemoteDebug"></a> Running a remote debugging session  
 You start, stop, and navigate a remote debug session the same way you do a local session. Before you start debugging, make sure the Remote Debugging Monitor is running on the remote device.  
  
 Then choose **Start Debugging** on the **Debug** menu (Keyboard: F5). The project is recompiled, then deployed to and started on the remote device. The debugger suspends execution at breakpoints, and you can step into, over, and out of your code. Choose **Stop Debugging** to end your debug session and close the remote app. For more information, see [Debug apps in Visual Studio](../debugger/debug-store-apps-in-visual-studio.md).
