# What's New in the XSLT Debugger

The following features are new in Visual Studio 2010.

## XSLT Profiler
 The XSLT Profiler is a tool that allows developers to measure, evaluate, and target performance-related problems in XSLT code by creating detailed XSLT performance reports. For more information, see [XSLT Profiler](../xml-tools/xslt-profiler.md).
