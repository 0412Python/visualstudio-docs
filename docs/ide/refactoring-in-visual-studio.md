# Refactoring code

Refactoring is the process of modifying code in order to make it easier to maintain, understand, and extend, but without changing its behavior. For more information, see the following pages:

* [Refactoring (C#)](../csharp-ide/refactoring-csharp.md)

* [Refactoring (Visual Basic)](../vb-ide/refactoring-vb.md)

* [Writing and refactoring code (C++)](/cpp/ide/writing-and-refactoring-code-cpp)

* [Visual F# Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FSharpSoftwareFoundation.VisualFPowerTools)&mdash;refactoring support for F# is provided in this third-party Visual Studio extension.
