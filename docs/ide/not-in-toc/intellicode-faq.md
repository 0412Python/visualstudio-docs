# Visual Studio IntelliCode FAQ

Thanks for your interest in IntelliCode for Visual Studio! We've provided this short FAQ to hopefully answer some of the questions you may have about the extension.

## Q. What is Visual Studio IntelliCode?

At Build 2018, we announced Visual Studio IntelliCode, a new capability that enhances software development using AI. IntelliCode helps developers and teams code with confidence, find issues faster, and focus code reviews.

We showed an early view of how IntelliCode enhances the software development process by delivering better context-aware code completions, guiding developers to adhere to the patterns and styles of their team, finding difficult-to-catch code issues, and focusing code reviews on areas that really matter.

Developers can find more information and sign up for news and future private previews at [https://aka.ms/intellicode](https://aka.ms/intellicode).

## Q. What does Visual Studio IntelliCode enable customers to do?

Visual Studio IntelliCode is a range of capabilities that offers new productivity enhancements through artificial intelligence (AI).

Developers can [download an experimental extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) for Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 and later. The extension provides enhanced IntelliSense that predicts the most likely correct API for the developer to use, rather than just presenting an alphabetical list of members. It uses the developer's current code context and patterns to provide this dynamic list. We'll update the extension with more capabilities in the coming months.

## Q: What makes “AI-assisted IntelliSense” powered by IntelliCode better than regular IntelliSense?

With IntelliCode, IntelliSense suggests the most likely correct API for a developer to use, rather than presenting a simple alphabetical list of members. It uses the developer's current code context, and patterns based on 2000 high quality, open-source projects on GitHub each with over 100 stars, to provide this dynamic list. The results form a model that predicts the most likely and most relevant API calls.

## Q. What's the future of IntelliCode?

We're exploring a wide range of ways to improve developer productivity using AI and other advanced techniques. At Build 2018, we showed an early view of some of the scenarios where we think AI could assist developers, but there are so many more! We're interested in learning from developers that experiment with what we've shown, so sign up for news and updates at [https://aka.ms/intellicode](https://aka.ms/intellicode).

## Q. How much does it cost?

We have no announcements regarding pricing at present.

## Q. When will IntelliCode be released?

IntelliCode is currently in its first preview. We have no schedule for a final release, but we welcome feedback from developers so we can deliver the best possible experiences. You can sign up for news and updates at [https://aka.ms/intellicode](https://aka.ms/intellicode).

## Q. Is this experience only available in Visual Studio?

The experience was shown at Build 2018 in Visual Studio 2017 on a C# codebase. However, we look forward to expanding IntelliCode to more languages and tools in the future.

## Q: What about privacy? Are you sending my code to the cloud? What customer data is being sent to Microsoft?

Developers are invited to experience Visual Studio IntelliCode today as an experimental preview extension. The purpose of the extension is to enable developers to test IntelliCode's capabilities and to provide feedback to the product team.

We capture some anonymized usage and error-reporting data from the extension to help improve the product. No user-defined code is sent to Microsoft, but we collect information about your use of the IntelliCode results. The data only includes open-source and .NET types and members that you selected from IntelliCode's suggested list. Developers can opt out of Visual Studio data collection, which turns off data collection for the IntelliCode extension too. From the menu bar, select **Help** > **Send Feedback** > **Settings**. In the **Visual Studio Experience Improvement Program** dialog, select **No, I would not like to participate** and then select **OK**.

The IntelliCode extension may periodically ask the developer to complete a survey, which again is anonymized. Users can sign up for news and a future private preview, but are not currently required to do so to use the experimental extension.

Future features may require access to a service, which will require sign-up. We'll publish more details when those features are ready for preview.
