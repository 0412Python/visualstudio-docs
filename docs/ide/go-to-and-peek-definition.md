# Go To Definition and Peek Definition  
The Go To Definition and Peek Definition features enable you to easily view the definition of a type or member.

## Go To Definition  
The Go To Definition feature navigates to the source of a type or member, and opens the result in a new tab. If you are a keyboard user, place your text cursor somewhere inside the type or member name and press **F12**. If you are a mouse user, either select **Go To Definition** from the context menu, or, in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.4 or later, press **CTRL** while selecting the type or member.

## Peek Definition
Preview the definition of a type in the code editor itself, instead of in a new tab:  

Input        | Function 
------------ | ---
**Keyboard** | Place your text cursor somewhere inside the type name, and press **Alt+F12**
**Mouse**    | Right-click on the type name and select **Peek Definition**

If you peek another definition from the popup window, you will start a breadcrumb path which you can navigate using the circles and arrows which appear above the popup. For more information, see [How to: View and Edit Code by Using Peek Definition (Alt+F12)](how-to-view-and-edit-code-by-using-peek-definition-alt-plus-f12.md).
