# Go To Definition and Peek Definition  
The Go To Definition and Peek Definition features enable you to easily view the definition of a type or member.

## Go To Definition  
The Go To Definition feature navigates to the source of a type or member, and opens the result in a new tab. If you are a keyboard user, place your text cursor somewhere inside the symbol name and press **F12**. If you are a mouse user, select **Go To Definition** from the context menu.  

## Peek Definition
The Peek Definition feature lets you preview the definition of a type without leaving your current location in the editor. If you are a keyboard user, place your text cursor somewhere inside the type or member name and press **Alt + F12**. If you are a mouse user, select **Peek Definition** from the context menu.  

If you peek another definition from the popup window, you will start a breadcrumb path which you can navigate using the circles and arrows which appear above the popup.
