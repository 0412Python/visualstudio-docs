# Accounts, Environment, Options dialog box

Use this page to set various options related to the accounts you use to sign in to Visual Studio.

## Personalization account

### Synchronize settings across devices

Use this option to specify whether to synchronize your settings across multiple machines. For more information, see [Synchronized settings](../../ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio.md).

### Enable device code flow

When this option is selected, the behavior of Visual Studio changes when you select **Add an account** on the **File** > **Account Settings** page. Instead of seeing the **Sign in to your account** page, you're presented with a dialog box that gives you a URL and a code to paste into a web browser to sign in. This option is useful in cases where you can't sign in to Visual Studio in the regular manner, for example, if you use an older version of Internet Explorer, or if your firewall restricts access. For more information, see [Work with multiple user accounts](../work-with-multiple-user-accounts.md#add-an-account-using-device-code-flow).
