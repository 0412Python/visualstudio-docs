# Code generation features in Visual Studio

There are numerous ways to have Visual Studio generate code for you in the editor. By doing so, you can save time and keystrokes, reduce syntax errors, and improve consistency across your code. Some of the features in Visual Studio that generate code for you include [code snippets](../../ide/code-snippets.md), [Quick Actions](../../ide/quick-actions.md), and [T4 text templates](../../modeling/code-generation-and-t4-text-templates.md). Additionally, you can generate XML-formatted comment blocks for your code that can later be processed to produce documentation automatically. You can also have Visual Studio generate method override signatures for you.
