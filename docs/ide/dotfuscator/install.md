# Install Dotfuscator Community Edition

This page details how to obtain Dotfuscator Community Edition (Dotfuscator CE) via the Visual Studio 2017 Installer, so that you can begin protecting your application.

If you have not yet installed Visual Studio 2017, you can obtain the installer from [the Visual Studio website][2017-install].

If you have already installed Visual Studio 2017, you can access the installer in the following way:

1. Open the Start Menu.
2. Select *All apps*.
3. From the list of apps, select *Visual Studio Installer*.
4. The Visual Studio installer opens. Under **Installed**, locate the edition to modify, and click *Modify*.

You can then install Dotfuscator CE as an individual component of Visual Studio 2017:

1. Select the **Individual components** tab.
2. Under *Code tools*, check the *PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator* item.<br/> <br/> ![](media/install_individually_12.png) <br/> <br/>
3. The *Summary* panel displays *PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator* under the *Individual Components* section. <br/> <br/> ![](media/install_individually_3.png) <br/> <br/>
4. Configure any further installation settings as appropriate for your environment.
5. When ready to install or modify your installation, click the *Install* or *Modify* button.

Once the installation is complete, you can start using Dotfuscator CE. For details, see [the Getting Started page of the full Dotfuscator CE User Guide][get-started].
