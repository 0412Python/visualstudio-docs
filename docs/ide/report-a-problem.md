# Report a problem 

Report a problem enables the Visual Studio developer community to submit issues and bugs.  Each one of your problem reports becomes a work item in our core engineering system, empowering you to engage directly with our product teams to help us identify impactful issues.  Your valuable feedback is critical to improving the Visual Studio product family and we really appreciate you taking the time to report a problem so we can diagnose and fix it.

In addition to reporting a problem, when you vote on feedback from other community members, you help us understand the impact it has for the larger developer community.

## FAQ

### How can I increase the chance of my problem getting resolved quickly?

We recommend using search to ensure that the problem you're about to report hasn't already been reported. If you find an existing item matching your problem, please follow and vote on that problem ticket.

Where possible, provide all the information you can to help our teams reproduce what you're experiencing.

### How is my feedback prioritized?

We receive a very large number of valuable suggestions from our customers. To ensure that we're bringing the best value to each of you in our developer community, we prioritize action on feedback that has the highest community impact. 

If we're not able to respond personally to your feedback, know that we fully appreciate your input. Please be assured that all your feedback gets to the right person and team. 

We truly value the time you invest in making Visual Studio better.

### What actions can I take if I'm not satisfied with the resolution?

Our teams do their best to diagnose and fix any issues you experience, however there may be times when you're not fully satisfied with our recommendation. Please comment back on the feedback and let us know exactly what you're not satisfied with, and we will try our best to ensure we meet your needs.

### How will I get notified of progress on my feedback?

Microsoft engineering teams will communicate with you by commenting on the feedback ticket and changing the state of your ticket as they make progress. Watch for e-mail notifications that are sent every time the ticket state changes or a comment is posted.

### Why can't I add a problem for Visual Studio IDE on the Developer Community website?

Reporting a problem through Visual Studio allows for diagnostic information to automatically be included in the report. This is essential to give our engineers the context they need to fully understand your issue and work to resolve it. 

When you initiate your problem report through Visual Studio, you're enabled to give our engineers an idea of your environment, send them a reproduction of the issue, and you can easily see if your problem has already been reported.
