# Personalize the Visual Studio IDE
You can personalize Visual Studio in various ways to best support your own development style and requirements. This topic briefly describes different personalizations and where to find more information.

Personalization options are also exposed through the [Environment options dialog box](../ide/reference/environment-options-dialog-box.md). Furthermore, many of your settings roam with you across Visual Studio instances. See [Synchronized settings](../ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio.md).

## Window layouts
You can define and save multiple window layouts and switch between them. For example, you can define one layout for coding and one for debugging. To arrange window positions and behavior and save custom layouts, see [Customizing window layouts](../ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio.md).  

## General environment options
To customize many environment settings, type `environment` in **QuickLaunch** and press **Enter**. When the property page appears, you can press  **F1** for more help on the various settings on that page. For more information, see [Environment options dialog box](../ide/reference/environment-options-dialog-box.md).  

## External tools
To customize which external tools appear in menus and toolbars, see [Managing external tools](../ide/managing-external-tools.md).  

## Start page
To create a custom start page for you and your team, see [Customizing the Start page](../ide/customizing-the-start-page-for-visual-studio.md).

## Environment color themes
To change the color theme between light, dark and blue, type "environment" in **QuickLaunch**, choose **Environment --> General**, and then change the **Color theme** option.

To change colorization options in the editor, type `environment` in **QuickLaunch** and choose **Environment --> Fonts and Colors**. See also [How to: Change fonts and colors](../ide/how-to-change-fonts-and-colors-in-visual-studio.md).  

### Menus and toolbars
To add or remove menu or toolbar items, see [How to: Customize menus and toolbars](../ide/how-to-customize-menus-and-toolbars-in-visual-studio.md).  

### Main menu casing
You can change the main menu casing between **Title Case** (such as "File") and **All Caps** ("FILE"). Type "environment" in **QuickLaunch**, select **Environment > General**, and then change the **Apply title case styling to menu bar** option.
