# Getting started with Visual Basic in Visual Studio
In this tutorial for Visual Basic development using Visual Studio, you'll create a few different Visual Basic console apps, add code to them, explore some features of the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), and run the apps.

If you haven't already installed Visual Studio, go to the [Visual Studio Downloads](https://aka.ms/vsdownload?utm_source=mscom&utm_campaign=msdocs) page to install it for free.

## Create a project
First, you'll create a Visual Basic application project. The project type comes with all the template files you'll need, before you've even added anything!

1. Open Visual Studio 2017.

2. From the top menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project...**.

3. In the **New Project** dialog box in the left pane, expand **Visual Basic**, and then choose **.NET Core**. In the middle pane, choose **Console App (.NET Core)**. Then name the file `Some Name TBD`.  

     If you don't see the **Console App (.NET Core)** project template, cancel out of the **New Project** dialog box and from the top menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features...**. The Visual Studio Installer launches. Choose the **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload, then choose **Modify**.

## Create the application

### Add some code
Let's add some code to pause the program in the console.

1. Add the following code

   ```vb

   ```
   This code prompts the user to press any key, which pauses program until a key is pressed.



## Run the application
1. Click the **Start** button to run the application.
