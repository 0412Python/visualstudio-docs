# Code generation features in Visual Studio

There are numerous ways to have Visual Studio generate code for you in the editor. By using these code generation features, you can save time and keystrokes, reduce syntax errors, and improve consistency across your code.

You can use [code snippets](../ide/code-snippets.md) to insert a template such as a [switch](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch) block or an [enum](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/enum) declaration.

You can use the [Quick Actions and Refactorings](../ide/quick-actions.md) menu to generate code such as classes and properties, or to introduce a local variable.

Because the logic of code generation is closely tied to language syntax, each language service in Visual Studio provides its own code generation capabilities.
