# Create an offline installation of Visual Studio 2017

If you are looking for an offline option for installing Visual Studio 2017, we can point you in the right direction.

* If you want to install a single instance of Visual Studio 2017 but your internet connection is unavailable or unreliable, see our [Install Visual Studio 2017 on low bandwidth or unreliable network environments](../install/install-visual-studio-in-offline-environment.md) page.  
* If you are an enterprise administrator who wants to perform a large deployment of Visual Studio 2017 to a network of client workstations that are firewalled from the internet, see our [Create a network installation of Visual Studio 2017](../install/create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md) and [Special considerations for installing Visual Studio in an offline environment](../install/install-visual-studio-in-offline-environment.md) pages.
