# What&#39;s new in Visual Studio 2019

**Updated for the [16.0 Preview 1 release](/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2019-relnotes?context=visualstudio/default&contextView=vs-2017)**

Visual Studio 2019 includes many general improvements along with new features that optimize developer productivity and team collaboration. Whether you are using Visual Studio for the first time or have been using it for years, you'll be able to take advantage of its features for all aspects of the development lifecycle&mdash;from simplified project creation and code health management, to team- and open-source collaborative workflows.

Here's a high-level recap of what Visual Studio has to offer:

* **[Personal and team productivity](#personal-and-team-productivity)**. Productivity for everyone where it matters most.
* **[Modern development support](#modern-development-support)**. Support for your current projects and future solutions.
* **[Continuous innovation](#discoverability)**. Code smart with intelligent, cloud-powered support.

> [!NOTE]
> For a complete list of new features and functionality in Visual Studio 2019, see the [Preview release notes](/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2019-preview-relnotes?context=visualstudio/default&contextView=vs-2017).

## Personal and team productivity

It's a given that performance improvements are top of mind with every release of Visual Studio, but right up there with it is improving your productivity. Here's how we can help with that.

### New start window

The first thing you'll notice when you open Visual Studio 2019 is its new start window.

   ![The new start window in Visual Studio 2019](../ide/media/start-window.png)

This new start window presents you with options to clone or checkout code, open a project or solution, open a local folder, or create a new project. Having these options presented in a simple dialog helps both beginners and advanced Visual Studio users get to code quickly.

### Improved search

Formerly known as Quick Launch, we've rewritten the new Search feature to make it faster and more effective. Now, search results are displayed dynamically as you type, and keyboard shortcuts are displayed next to search results for commands so you can more easily memorize them for future use.

Whether you are looking for commands, settings, documentation, or other useful things, the new Search feature makes it easier to find what you're looking for.

### CodeLens for everyone

Before, CodeLens was a feature that you could find only in the Visual Studio Enterprise edition. Starting with Visual Studio 2019, it's now available in the free Community edition as well.

Use CodeLens to find references to a piece of code, changes to your code, linked bugs, work items, code reviews, and unit tests&mdash;without leaving the editor. To find out more, see the [Find code changes and other history with CodeLens](../ide/find-code-changes-and-other-history-with-codelens.md) page.

### One-click Code Cleanup

Paired with a new Document Health Indicator feature is a new one-click Code Cleanup feature that you can use to fix all your code in one fell swoop.

   ![The new Code Cleanup feature in Visual Studio 2019](../ide/media/code-cleanup.png)

The cleanup will format the code and apply any code fixes suggested by the current settings, .editorconfig files, or Roslyn analyzers.

### Debugger improvements

#### Search within a Watch window

You've probably been there before, looking in the watch window for a string amongst a sea of values. We've enhanced search in the various watch windows (locals, auto, and watch). Now, Visual Studio can do that looking for you!

### Live Share

[Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) is a new tool that allows you to share a codebase and its context with a teammate and get instant bi-directional collaboration directly from within Visual Studio. With Live Share, a teammate can read, navigate, edit, and debug a project that you've shared with them, and do so seamlessly and securely.

For more information, see the [Live Share FAQ](/visualstudio/liveshare/faq).

## Give us feedback

Why send feedback to the Visual Studio team? Because we take customer feedback seriously. It drives much of what we do.

* If you want to make a suggestion about how we can improve Visual Studio, see the [Suggest a feature](../ide/talk-to-us.md) page.

* If you experience a hang, crash, or other performance issue, you can easily share repro steps and supporting files with us by using the [**Report a Problem**](how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017.md) tool.
