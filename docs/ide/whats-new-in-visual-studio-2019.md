## Individual productivity

## Team productivity

### Live Share

[Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)** is a new tool that allows you to share a codebase and its context with a teammate and get instant bi-directional collaboration directly from within Visual Studio. With Live Share, a teammate can read, navigate, edit, and debug a project that you've shared with them, and do so seamlessly and securely.

For more information, see the [Live Share FAQ](/visualstudio/liveshare/faq).

## Discoverability
