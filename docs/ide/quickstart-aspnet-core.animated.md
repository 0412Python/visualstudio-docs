# Quickstart: Use Visual Studio to create your first ASP.NET Core web app

In this 5-10 minute introduction to how to use Visual Studio, you'll create a simple "Hello World" web app by using an ASP.NET project template and the C# programming language.

If you haven't already installed Visual Studio, go to the [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2017) page to install it for free.

## Create a project

First, you'll create an ASP.NET Core web application project. Here's how.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't see the **.NET Core** project template category, choose the **Open Visual Studio Installer** link in the left pane.

## Create and run the app

Next, you'll create and run your "Hello World" web app. Here's how.
