# Quickstart: first look at the Visual Studio IDE

In this 5-10 minute introduction to the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), we'll take a tour of the most-used menus, windows, and toolbars.

## Start Page

The first thing you'll see after you launch Visual Studio is most likely going to be the Start Page. The Start Page is designed as a "hub" to help you find the commands and project files you need faster.

You can also [customize the Start page](../ide/customizing-the-start-page-for-visual-studio.md).

## Solution Explorer

## Menus

## Error List
