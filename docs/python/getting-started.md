# Getting Started with Python in Visual Studio

Once you have Visual Studio installed with the Python workload (Visual Studio 2017), or with the Python Tools for Visual Studio (Visual Studio 2015 and earlier), you're ready to explore the Python development experience.

In this walkthrough you'll create a new empty Python application, choose a Python environment to work with, and then start writing some code to see IntelliSense at work. You'll then work with the interactive REPL window for a short time to create more code, then complete the program and run it both by itself and in the debugger.

## Create a new Python project

## Setting up a Python environment

## Writing code

## Using the interactive REPL window

## Running code in the debugger

## Next steps

In this walkthrough you've touched on the main elements of the Python experience in Visual Studio. To go deeper, explore the following topics in the documentation:

- [Publishing a Python web application to Azure](publishing-to-azure.md)
- [Editing Code)](code-editing.md)
- [Interactive Python (REPL) window](interactive-repl.md)
- [Debugging](debugging.md)
- [Profiling](profiling.md)
- [Unit Testing](unit-testing.md)
