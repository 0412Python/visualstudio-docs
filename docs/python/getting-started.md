# Getting Started with Python in Visual Studio

Once you have Visual Studio installed with the Python workload (Visual Studio 2017), or with the Python Tools for Visual Studio (Visual Studio 2015 and earlier), you're ready to explore the Python development experience.

In this walkthrough you'll create a new empty Python application, choose a Python environment to work with, and then start writing some code to see IntelliSense at work. You'll then work with the interactive REPL window for a short time to create more code, then complete the program and run it both by itself and in the debugger.

## Create a new Python project

Python support in Visual Studio includes a number of [project templates](python-projects-in-visual-studio.md) to get you started with different types of projects, including web applications using the Bottle, Flask, and Django frameworks along with Azure Cloud Services. For the purposes of this walkthrough, however, we'll start with an empty project.

1. In Visual Studio, select **File > New Project**, which brings up the **New Project** dialog. This is where you can browse and select a template and specify the folder in which to create the project:

1. Python templates can be found under the **Templates > Other Languages > Python** on the left, or by simply searching on "Python":

1. Select the "Empty Python Application" template, specify a folder for the project, and select **OK**.

1. After a few moments, you'll see the project open in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window. Here you can browse the files and folders in your project, as well as manage environments, as we'll do next.
