# Update Visual Studio 2017 to the most recent release
We update Visual Studio often to extend its functionality and to fix customer-reported issues. To make sure you have the most [current, optimized release of Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#release-history), you'll want to update it. Here's how.

## Update by using the Notification Hub
When there are updates, you will see a notification flag in Visual Studio.



1. Click the notification, which will open the Notification Hub.

2. Review the list of updates that are available, and click x.

## Update by using the Visual Studio Installer
1.	Open the installer. You might need to update the installer before continuing. If this is the case, you'll be prompted to do so.
 >[!NOTE]
 > On a computer running Windows 10, you'll find the installer under the letter **V** as the **Visual Studio Installer**, or under the letter **M** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.

2.	On the Product page in the installer, look for the edition of Visual Studio that you have installed.

3.	If an Update is available, you'll see an Update button. (It might take a few seconds for the installer to determine whether an update is available.)

4.	Click or tap the Update button to install the updates.

## Get support
Sometimes, things can go wrong. If your Visual Studio installation fails, see the [Troubleshooting Visual Studio 2017 installation and upgrade failures](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4015967/troubleshooting-visual-studio-2017-installation-and-upgrade-failures) KB article for troubleshooting tips.
