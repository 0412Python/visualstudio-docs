# Update Visual Studio 2017 to the most recent release
We update Visual Studio often to extend its functionality and to fix customer-reported issues. To make sure you have the most [current, optimized release of Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#release-history), you'll want to update it. Here's how.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To install, update, or modify Visual Studio, you must log on with an account that has administrative permissions. For more information, see [User Permissions and Visual Studio](../ide/user-permissions-and-visual-studio.md).

## Update by using the Notifications hub
1. When there are updates, you will see a notification flag in Visual Studio.

  ![Update Visual Studio 2017 by using the Notification hub](media/notification-flag.png "The Notification flag in Visual Studio")

  Click or tap the notification flag to open the **Notifications** hub.

2. Click or tap **"Visual Studio Update" is available**, which opens the **Extensions and Updates** dialog box.

3. In the **Extensions and Updates** dialog box, click or tap the **Update** button.

### More about Visual Studio notifications

Not only does Visual Studio notify you when an update is available for Visual Studio itself or for any of the components, but it also notifies you of certain kinds of events that occur in the Visual Studio environment:

* When the notification flag is red, it means that there is a problem with your license.
* When it's yellow, there is a Visual Studio product update available for you to install.
* When it is "normal" or black, you'll see messages that are informational or optional, such as crashes for which you might want to find a workaround.

You can click on the icon to open the **Notifications** hub and choose which ones to act on. You can choose to do a one-time dismiss on a notification, or to always ignore a notification by hovering over it.

If you choose to always ignore a notification, Visual Studio will stop showing it. If you want to reset the list of ignored notifications, click the **Settings** button in the Notifications hub.

## Update by using the Visual Studio Installer
1.	Open the installer. You might need to update the installer before continuing. If this is the case, you'll be prompted to do so.
 >[!NOTE]
 > On a computer running Windows 10, you'll find the installer under the letter **V** as the **Visual Studio Installer**, or under the letter **M** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.

2.	On the **Product** page in the installer, look for the edition of Visual Studio that you have installed.

3.	If an update is available, you'll see an **Update** button. (It might take a few seconds for the installer to determine whether an update is available.)

  Click or tap the **Update** button to install the updates.
