Sometimes, things can go wrong. If your Visual Studio installation fails, see the [Troubleshooting Visual Studio 2017 installation and upgrade issues](../troubleshooting-installation-issues.md) page. If none of the troubleshooting steps help, contact us by [live chat](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/#talktous) (English only). 

Here are a few more support options:

* You can report product issues to us via the [Report a Problem](../../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017.md) tool that appears both in the Visual Studio Installer and in the Visual Studio IDE.
* You can share a product suggestion with us on [UserVoice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579).
* You can track product issues and find answers in the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/).
* You can also engage with us and other Visual Studio developers through the [Visual Studio conversation in the Gitter community](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/VisualStudio). (This option requires a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.)
