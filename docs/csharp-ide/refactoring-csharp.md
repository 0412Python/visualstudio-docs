# Refactoring
Refactoring is the process of improving your code after it has been written by changing the internal structure of the code without changing the external behavior of the code.  
  
Visual C# provides the following refactoring features:  
  
* [Change Method Signature](refactoring/change-method-signature.md)
* [Encapsulate Field](refactoring/encapsulate-field.md)
* [Extract Interface](refactoring/extract-interface.md)
* [Extract Method](refactoring/extract-method.md)
* [Inline Temporary Variable](refactoring/inline-temporary-variable.md)
* [Move Type to Matching File](refactoring/move-type-to-matching-file.md)
* [Rename](refactoring/rename.md)
