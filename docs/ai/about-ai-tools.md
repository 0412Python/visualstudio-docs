# What is AI Tools for Visual Studio?

AI Tools for Visual Studio is a cross-platform integrated development environment to build, test, and deploy deep learning solutions. It enables a broad spectrum of developers, ranging from an individual developer or a student who's interested in building their first deep learning models and AI applications; a team of developers who are creating sophisticated models in collaboration with data scientists, and need a tool-chain for better authoring, debugging and profiling; enterprise developers who have rich cloud resources and are building AI products with the efforts of developers, researchers and data scientists.

AI Tools for Visual Studio enables easily creating deep learning models and intelligent applications. 

- **Full-featured IDE for different Deep Learning languages across Windows, Linux and macOS.** AI Tools builds atop [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), and will be atop [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with sets of plugins. Such diversity helps users to cut down the learning cost and improve the cross-platform productivity. It supports various Deep Learning frameworks including [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-toolkit/), [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/), [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Caffe2](https://caffe2.ai/). Other frameworks could be easily incorporated into the open architecture. AI Tools leverages existing code support for Python, C/C++/C#, and supplies new ones such as CNTK BrainScript.

- **Rich development experiences (editor and debugger) for productive Deep Learning applications.** Familiar editor features are integrated, such as Syntax Highlighting, Code Snippet (template), IntelliSense (auto-completion), Code Fix, Contextual Help, and Text Auto Formatting. AI Tools is designed to be extensible for various Deep Learning specific tools. Users could interactively test their applications in the local environment by single-step debugging on the variables and models.

- **Cloud deployment.** AI Tools permits submitting Deep Learning jobs to [Azure Batch AI Training](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch-ai/)(Preview), Philly GPU compute cluster, Bing MultiTenancy cluster, or a single remote GPU machine such as [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/). The unified graphical UI presents convenient cloud management features such as job cancellation/detail view/comparison/diagnosis, and resource upload/download.
