# Visual Studio Tools for AI Overview 

Visual Studio Tools for AI is an extension to build, test, and deploy Deep Learning / AI solutions. It seamlessly integrates with Azure Machine Learning for robust experimentation capabilities, including but not limited to submitting data preparation and model training jobs transparently to different compute targets. Additionally, it provides support for custom metrics and run history tracking, enabling data science reproducibility and auditing. Enterprise ready collaboration, allow to securely work on project with other people.

Get started with deep learning using [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](http://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-toolkit), [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), or other deep-learning frameworks today.  
 
## Features

### Develop deep learning models and AI solutions 
VS Tools for AI is a free extension that supports deep learning frameworks including [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](http://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-toolkit), [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and more.  

Because it's an IDE we've enabled familiar code editor features like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (auto-completion) and text auto formatting. You can interactively test your deep learning application in your local environment using step-through debugging on local variables and models.

### Find and share examples via the gallery  
Visual Studio Tools for AI is integrated with Azure Machine Learning to make it easy to browse through a gallery of sample experiments using CNTK, TensorFlow, MMLSpark, and more. This makes it easy to learn and share with others. 

### Scale out deep learning model training and/or inferencing to the cloud
This extension makes it easy to train models on your local computer or you can submit jobs to the cloud by using our integration with Azure Machine Learning. You can submit jobs to different compute targets like Spark clusters, Azure GPU virtual machines and more  

## Exploring project samples
Visual Studio Tools for AI comes with a Sample Explorer via integration with Azure Machine Learning. The Sample Explorer makes it easy to discover samples and try them with only a few clicks. 

> [!TIP]
> You will need Azure Machine Learning Workbench to be installed. See instructions at [How to install Azure Machine Learning Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/preview/quickstart-installation)  

To open the explorer, do the following:   
1. Open the command palette (View > **Command Palette** or **Ctrl+Shift+P**).
2. Enter "ML Sample". 
3. You get a recommendation for "Machine Learning: Open Azure Machine Learning Samples Explorer", select it and press enter.
