# CA0062

The rule '*RuleId*' referenced in rule set '*RuleSetName*' could not be found.

This error indicates that the specified rule could not be found.

This error usually occurs because a rule set file was edited by hand. To avoid this error, you can use the Visual Studio rule set editor to configure code analysis rules. For more information, see [Create a custom rule set](../code-quality/how-to-create-a-custom-rule-set.md).

To resolve this issue, make sure that all the check ids that are specified in your *.ruleset* file are valid. if you are using a non-standard rule set file, make sure that the appropriate rule hint paths are specified in the file.
