# C26455 DEFAULT_CTOR_NOEXCEPT
The C++ Core Guidelines suggest that default constructors should not perform any operation that can throw.
If the default constructor is allowed to throw, operations like move and swap will therefore have to throw and this is undesirable as move and swap should always succeed.
Parameterized constructors may throw.

## Remarks
Consider the default constructors of the STL types, like std::vector. In these implementations, the default constructor simply initializes its internal state, but does not perform any allocations. The same pattern should be followed for all default constructors.

[C++ Core Guideline for this warning.](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rf-noexcept)
