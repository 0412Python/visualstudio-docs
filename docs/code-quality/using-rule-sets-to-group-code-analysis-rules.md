# Use rule sets to group code analysis rules

When you configure code analysis in Visual Studio, you can choose from a list of built-in *rule sets*. A rule set is a logical grouping of code analysis rules that identify targeted issues and specific conditions. For example, you can apply a rule set that is designed to scan code for publicly available APIs, or you can apply a rule set that includes only the minimum recommended rules. You can also apply a rule set that includes all the rules.

You can customize a rule set by adding or deleting rules, or by changing rule severities to appear as either warnings or errors in the **Error List**. Customized rule sets can fulfill a need for your particular development environment. When you customize a rule set, the rule set page provides search and filtering tools to help you in the process.
