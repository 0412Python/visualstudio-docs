# How to: Configure Code Analysis for a Managed Code Project

In Visual Studio, you can choose from a list of code analysis *rule sets* to apply to a managed code project. The default rule set is *Microsoft Minimum Recommended Rules*. You can apply another rule set to a project or to all projects in a solution.

> [!TIP]
> For information about how to configure a rule set for ASP.NET Web applications, see [How to: Configure Code Analysis for an ASP.NET Web Application](../code-quality/how-to-configure-code-analysis-for-an-aspnet-web-application.md).

## To configure a rule set for a .NET Framework project

1. Open the **Code Analysis** tab on the project's property pages. You can do this in either of the following ways:

   - In **Solution Explorer**, select the project. On the menu bar, select **Analyze** > **Configure Code Analysis** > **For \<projectname>**.

   - Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**, and then select the **Code Analysis** tab.

1. In the **Configuration** and **Platform** lists, select the build configuration and target platform.

1. To run code analysis every time the project is built using the selected configuration, select the **Enable Code Analysis on Build** check box. You can also run code analysis manually by selecting **Analyze** > **Run Code Analysis** > **Run Code Analysis on \<projectname>**.

1. By default, code analysis does not report warnings from code that is automatically generated by external tools. To view warnings from generated code, clear the **Suppress results from generated code** check box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This option does not suppress code analysis errors and warnings from generated code when the errors and warnings appear in forms and templates. You can both view and maintain the source code for a form or a template, without having it overwritten.

1. In the **Run this rule set** list, do one of the following:

    - Select the rule set that you want to use.

    - Select **\<Browse...>** to find an existing custom rule set that is not in the list.

    - Define a custom rule set. For more information, see [Creating Custom Rule Sets](../code-quality/creating-custom-code-analysis-rule-sets.md).
